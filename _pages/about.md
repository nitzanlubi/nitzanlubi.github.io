I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [computaitonal memory lab](https://compmem.princeton.edu/) and at the [Turk-Browne lab](https://ntblab.yale.edu/), working with Drs [Ken Norman](https://pni.princeton.edu/people/kenneth-norman)  and [Nick Turk-Browne](https://psychology.yale.edu/people/nick-turk-browne). As part of my research, I also collaborate with [Dr. Yvette Sheline](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8659512) from the department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvenia. Prior to this, I recieved my PhD in Psychology from Tel Aviv University, mentored by [Dr. Talma Hendler](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/thendler). Before that, I studied at the [Adi Latuman Interdisciplinary program for outstanding students](https://excellent.tau.ac.il/english) at the Tel aviv University, focusing on Psychology, Biology and Philosophy, and completing my M.Sc. degree at the Sagol School of Neuroscience.

My research revolves around human learning and memory, and the development and application of self-neuromodulation techniques to change cognition and behavior. Im my PhD, I investigated the link between the human reward system and peripheral immunity, and the underlying computational principles of self-neuromodulation (neurofeedback). In my current postdoctoral research, I use decoding-based fMRI neurpfeedback to reduce negative attentional biases in individuals with Major Depression. I also investigate how prior knowledge shapes new associative learning using neural networks modeling, behavioral experiments and time-resolved neuroiumaging (SQUID and a next-generation OPM-MEG). More information can be found in the research tab.
