As part of my research, I also collaborate with [Dr. Yvette Sheline](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8659512) from the department of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvenia. My current research focuses on human learning and memory, and on the development and application of self-neuromodulation techniques to change cognition and behavior. Prior to this, I recieved my PhD in Psychology from Tel Aviv University, working with [Dr. Talma Hendler](https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/thendler). Before that, I studied at the [Adi Latuman Interdisciplinary program for outstanding students](https://excellent.tau.ac.il/english) at the Tel aviv University, focusing on Psychology, Biology and Philosophy, and completing my M.Sc. degree at the Sagol School of Neuroscience.
